## TOA Skill Exchange:

## A More Sustainable Future with Cleaner Energy and Clearer Data

Did you know, data can actually change lives for the better?

### Clean energy and a more sustainable future with Data

The process of producing and using energy is changing rapidly. Digital energy products based on data are essential for a sustainable future. The more information thatâ€™s gathered ensures an accurate analysis and prediction - only if you know how to decipher it. No programming skills? No problem. Tableau provides a revolutionary approach to business intelligence, to help people see and understand their data.

Our keynote speakers and coaches in 2 intimate breakout sessions will teach you more about how we can use big data to solve big problems.

### Sustainability Genius (Hermann Schweizer, Global CTO sonnen GmbH)

Discussion: The need for interpretable data for a more sustainable future.

### Solution Mastermind (David Klein, Solution Engineer, Tableau Software)

The Importance of Data-Driven Decisions During a Pandemic
Learn how to shift from an intuition-based approach to a data-driven culture by successfully combining big data with self-service analytics.

### Data Expert (Dilyana Bossenz, Business Intelligence Consultant, M2. technology & project consulting GmbH)

[ sonnen offers a wide range of services for clean energy including, sonnenBatterie, the networked energy community 'sonnenCommunity' and 'sonnenFlat', where customers no longer have electricity bills.

The sonnenBatterie is an intelligent high-tech energy storage device. In combination with a photovoltaic system and a sonnenBatterie, a single-family house can cover around 75% of its annual electricity needs with self-produced solar electricity. sonnen only uses lithium iron phosphate batteries (LiFePO4) for its storage systems, which are considered to be more durable and safer than numerous other lithium-ion batteries that are used in smartphones, PCs and electric cars. Thanks to this durable technology, owners are guaranteed 10,000 charging cycles. The service life of the sonnenBatterie is designed for 20 years.

Since 2015, the owners of a sonnenBatterie in the sonnenCommunity, Germany's first decentralized energy community, have been able to digitally network with each other and thus share electricity with other people on a balance sheet. If the battery storage is already fully charged and the PV system is producing more electricity than the household needs, the excess electricity can be fed into the power grid. Other members who are not producing enough energy, for example due to bad weather, can obtain this cleanly produced solar power from the sonnenCommunity. The sonnenCommunity replaces the previous electricity supplier 100 percent.

Members of the sonnenCommunity also have the option of connecting to the sonnen's battery pool made up of thousands of networked sonnenBatterien. This creates a virtual large storage system that is large enough to compensate for short-term fluctuations in the German power grid. If you, as a member of the sonnenCommunity, make your sonnenBatterie available for a few minutes a day, you will receive free electricity in return, so that electricity costs no longer play a role.

Sonnen has already installed over 60,000 sonnenBatterien worldwide, making it the market leader for intelligent electricity storage systems. ]
