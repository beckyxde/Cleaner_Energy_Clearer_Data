# TOA Skill Exchange: A More Sustainable Future with Cleaner Energy and Clearer Data

Did you know, data can actually change lives for the better?

# Clean energy and a more sustainable future with Data

The process of producing and using energy is changing rapidly. Digital energy products based on data are essential for a sustainable future. The more information thatâ€™s gathered ensures an accurate analysis and prediction - only if you know how to decipher it. No programming skills? No problem. Tableau provides a revolutionary approach to business intelligence, to help people see and understand their data.
